## Within the destructuring of a single variable, both by-move and by-reference pattern bindings can be used at the same time. Doing this will result in a partial move of the variable, which means that parts of the variable will be moved while other parts stay. In such a case, the parent variable cannot be used afterwards as a whole, however the parts that are only referenced (and not moved) can still be used.
# Example:
```rs
fn main() {
    #[derive(Debug)]
    struct Person {
        name: String,
        age: Box<u8>,
    }

    let person = Person {
        name: String::from("Alice"),
        age: Box::new(20),
    };

    // `name` is moved out of person, but `age` is referenced
    let Person { name, ref age } = person;

    println!("The person's age is {}", age);

    println!("The person's name is {}", name);

    // Error! borrow of partially moved value: `person` partial move occurs
    //println!("The person struct is {:?}", person);

    // `person` cannot be used but `person.age` can be used as it is not moved
    println!("The person's age from person struct is {}", person.age);
}
```

```rs
fn main() {
   let t = (String::from("hello"), String::from("world"));

   let _s = t.0;

   // Modify this line only, don't use `_s`
   println!("{:?}", t);
}
```
# Solution:
```rs
fn main() {
   let t = (String::from("hello"), String::from("world"));

   let _s = t.0;

   // Modify this line only, don't use `_s`
   println!("{:?}", t.1);
}

```rs

   let t = (String::from("hello"), String::from("world"));

    // Fill the blanks
    let (__, __) = __;

    println!("{:?}, {:?}, {:?}", s1, s2, t); // -> "hello", "world", ("hello", "world")
}
```
# Solution:
```rs

fn main() {
   let t = (String::from("hello"), String::from("world"));

    // Fill the blanks
    let (s1, s2) = t.clone();

    println!("{:?}, {:?}, {:?}", s1, s2, t); // -> "hello", "world", ("hello", "world")
